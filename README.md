# 1. General introduction of this repository
1.1 This repository aims at providing the codes and data regarding the paper entitled “……” for the public, and it is developed by the XXX university in China, The University of XX in Hong Kong SAR.

1.2 We greatly appreciate the selfless spirits of these voluntary contributors of a series of open python libraries, including Baichuan-inc(https://huggingface.co/baichuan-inc),LLaMA-Factory (https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory), ChatGLM3-6b (https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm3-6b), Qwen (https://huggingface.co/Qwen), numpy, and so on. Our work stands on the shoulders of these giants

1.3 All of the codes have been tested to be well-performed. Even so, we are not able to guarantee their operation in other computing environments due to the differences in the Python version, computer operating system, and adopted hardware.

# 4. Reuse of the test dataset for construction case-relevant article-level law identification
The test dataset includes 15,549 real-world construction-related cases, and each case is dissected and labelled for "Facts", "Case types", "Cited acts", "Cited articles", and "Cited articles with specific content".
